# Roadmap

ProbOS is organized as a starship crew — specialized teams of agents working together to keep the system operational, secure, and evolving. Each team is a dedicated agent pool with distinct responsibilities. The Captain (human operator) approves major decisions through a stage gate.

### Ship's Computer (Runtime Services)

Not a team — shared infrastructure that all teams use:

- **CodebaseIndex** — structural self-awareness, the ship's technical manual (Phase 29c)
- **Knowledge Store** — long-term memory, the ship's library
- **Episodic Memory + Dreaming** — experiential learning, the ship's log
- **Trust Network** — reputation system, crew performance records
- **Intent Bus** — internal communications, the ship's intercom
- **Hebbian Router** — navigation, learned routing pathways

### The Federation

Each ProbOS instance is a ship. Multiple instances form a federation:

| Star Trek Concept | ProbOS Equivalent | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Starship | Single ProbOS instance | Built |
| Ship departments | Agent pools (crew teams) | In progress |
| Ship's computer | Runtime + CodebaseIndex + Knowledge Store | Built |
| Federation | Federated ProbOS instances | Built (Phase 29) |
| Diplomatic relations | Trust transitivity between nodes | Roadmap |
| Shared intelligence | Knowledge federation | Roadmap |
| Prime Directive | Safety constraints, boundary rules, human gate | Built |

## Team Details

### Medical Team (Phase 29b)

*"Please state the nature of the medical emergency."*

A dedicated pool of specialized agents that monitor, diagnose, and remediate ProbOS health issues. Modeled as a medical team where each agent has a distinct role in the health lifecycle.

**Vitals Monitor (Nurse)**

- HeartbeatAgent subclass, always running at low overhead
- Tracks: response latency, trust score trends, pool utilization, error rates, dream consolidation rates, memory usage
- Raises structured alerts (severity + metric + threshold + current value) to the Diagnostician
- Does not diagnose or act — observes and escalates only

**Diagnostician**

- CognitiveAgent triggered by Vitals Monitor alerts or on a configurable schedule
- Runs structured health assessment (extends IntrospectAgent._system_health())
- Compares current state to historical baselines stored in episodic memory
- Root cause analysis: agent-level, pool-level, or system-level
- Produces a structured Diagnosis with severity, affected components, and recommended treatment

**Surgeon (Remediation)**

- CognitiveAgent that takes corrective action based on Diagnostician findings
- Actions: recycle degraded agents, trigger emergency dream cycles via force_dream(), rebalance pools via pool_scaler, prune stale episodic memory
- Actions are trust-scored via Shapley contribution — did the intervention actually fix the problem?
- High-impact actions (pruning agents, config changes) can require human approval via the approval gate

**Pharmacist (Tuning)**

- CognitiveAgent for slow-acting, trend-based configuration adjustments
- Analyzes patterns over time: "sessions average 4 minutes, idle dream threshold should be 60s not 120s"
- Produces configuration recommendations with justification and expected impact
- Changes applied through the existing config system with audit trail

**Pathologist (Post-Mortem)**

- CognitiveAgent triggered by escalation Tier 3 hits, consensus failures, or agent crashes
- Produces structured post-mortems stored in episodic memory and (future) evolution store
- Identifies recurring failure patterns across sessions
- Findings feed into the self-improvement pipeline (Phase 30) as improvement signals

---

### Codebase Knowledge Service (Phase 29c)

*The ship's technical manual — available to any crew member.*

ProbOS already has runtime self-awareness — it knows what agents are doing, their trust scores, and routing patterns. This phase adds structural self-awareness: understanding how ProbOS is built, not just how it's behaving. Access is shared across agents via a skill, like a library that any crew member can visit.

**CodebaseIndex (Runtime Service)**

- Built at startup, cached in memory, read-only during a session
- Scans `src/probos/` and builds a structured map:
  - File tree with module-level descriptions
  - Agent registry: type, tier, pool, capabilities, intent descriptors
  - Layer organization: substrate, mesh, consensus, cognitive, federation
  - Key APIs: public methods on Runtime, TrustNetwork, IntentBus, HebbianRouter, etc.
  - Configuration schema: what's tunable, current values, and where each parameter lives
- Indexed by concept, not just filename ("how does trust work?" maps to the relevant files)
- No LLM calls — pure AST/inspection-based indexing

**`codebase_knowledge` Skill (Shared Crew Capability)**

- Any CognitiveAgent can use this skill to query the codebase
- Methods: `query_architecture(concept)`, `read_source(file, lines)`, `search_code(pattern)`, `get_agent_map()`, `get_layer_map()`, `get_config_schema()`
- Returns structured, context-aware answers rather than raw file contents
- Used by: Medical (Pathologist, Diagnostician), Science (Architect, Research), Engineering (Builder), Bridge (IntrospectAgent)

---

### Security Team (Phase 31)

*"Shields up. Red alert."*

Formalize threat detection and defense as a dedicated agent pool. Builds on existing security infrastructure (red team agents, SSRF protection).

- **Threat Detector** — monitors inbound requests for prompt injection, adversarial input, abnormal patterns
- **Trust Integrity Monitor** — detects trust score manipulation, coordinated attacks on consensus, Sybil patterns
- **Input Validator** — rate limiting enforcement, payload size limits, content policy
- **Red Team Lead** — coordinates existing red team agents, schedules adversarial verification campaigns
- Existing: Red team agents (built), SSRF protection (AD-285), prompt injection scanner (roadmap)

---

### Engineering Team (Phase 32)

*"I'm givin' her all she's got, Captain!"*

Automated performance optimization, maintenance, and construction. The team that keeps the ship running and builds new capabilities.

- **Performance Monitor** — tracks latency, throughput, memory pressure, identifies bottlenecks (what AD-289 did manually, but automated)
- **Maintenance Agent** — database compaction, log rotation, cache eviction, connection pool management
- **Builder Agent** — executes build prompts, constructs new capabilities (bridges to external coding agents initially)
- **Infrastructure Agent** — disk space monitoring, dependency health, environment validation
- Existing: PoolScaler handles some Ops/Engineering overlap

---

### Operations Team (Phase 33)

*"Rerouting power to forward shields."*

Formalize resource management and system coordination as an agent pool.

- **Resource Allocator** — workload balancing across pools, demand prediction, capacity planning
- **Scheduler** — task prioritization, queue management, deadline enforcement (extends Phase 24c TaskScheduler)
- **Coordinator** — cross-team orchestration during high-load or emergency events
- Existing: PoolScaler (built), TaskScheduler (Phase 24c roadmap), IntentBus demand tracking (built)

---

### MCP Federation Adapter (Phase 29)

*A universal translator for the wider agent ecosystem.*

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is becoming the standard for inter-agent tool sharing. ProbOS supports it as a federation transport alongside ZeroMQ — connecting ProbOS to external agent frameworks, IDEs, and MCP-compatible tools without requiring them to run ProbOS.

**Inbound (MCP Server)**

- ProbOS exposes its agent capabilities as MCP tools
- MCP tool calls are translated to `IntentMessage` and dispatched through the intent bus
- MCP-originated intents go through the same governance pipeline as any federated intent: consensus, red team verification, escalation
- The MCP adapter is a transport, not a trust bypass

**Outbound (MCP Client)**

- ProbOS discovers and invokes capabilities on external MCP servers
- External tool definitions translated to `IntentDescriptor` and registered as federated capabilities
- `FederationRouter` routes intents to MCP-connected systems alongside ZeroMQ-connected ProbOS nodes
- External capabilities carry federated trust discount (same δ factor as trust transitivity)

**MCP Client Trust**

- MCP clients treated as federated peers with configurable trust
- New clients start with probationary trust (same `Beta(alpha, beta)` prior as new agents — AD-110)
- Trust updated based on outcome quality of submitted intents
- Destructive intents from MCP clients always require full consensus regardless of accumulated trust

**Transport Coexistence**

- ZeroMQ remains the primary intra-Nooplex transport (fast, binary, low-latency)
- MCP serves the boundary between ProbOS and the wider agent ecosystem
- `FederationBridge` becomes transport-polymorphic: ZeroMQ and MCP implementations behind a shared interface

---

### Skill Manifest Format (Phase 30)

*A standard manifest for portable, publishable skills.*

Inspired by OpenClaw's declarative skill metadata. Standardizes how skills are described, discovered, and distributed — foundation for the Agent Marketplace.

- **Manifest file** (`skill.yaml`) — name, description, version, author, license, required dependencies, platform constraints, ProbOS version compatibility
- **Dependency declaration** — Python packages, system binaries, external services needed
- **Auto-installation** — skills declare their dependencies; runtime installs them on first use
- **Discovery protocol** — skills can be searched, browsed, and installed from registries
- **Testing contract** — manifest includes test commands, expected coverage, integration test requirements
- Pairs with the commercial Agent Marketplace for publishing and distribution

---

### Task Ledger (Phase 33 — Operations Team)

*Two-loop architecture for long-horizon task management.*

Inspired by Microsoft Magentic-One's Task Ledger + Progress Ledger pattern. Structured tracking for multi-step, multi-agent tasks with adaptive replanning.

- **Task Ledger** — tracks facts (confirmed), guesses (unverified), plan (ordered steps), and blockers for each active long-horizon task
- **Progress Ledger** — per-subtask tracking: assigned agent, status, output, retries, duration
- **Adaptive replanning** — when progress stalls or a subtask fails, revise the plan using updated facts and lessons learned
- Extends Phase 24c TaskScheduler from "schedule and run" to "schedule, track, and adapt"
- Integrates with Evolution Store — task outcomes feed back as lessons for future planning

---

### Agent-as-Tool Invocation (Phase 26)

*Explicit agent-to-agent capability consumption.*

Allows one agent to explicitly invoke another agent's capability as a typed function call, complementing the implicit collaboration that already happens through the intent bus.

- **`AgentTool` wrapper** — any agent can be consumed as a tool by another agent with typed input/output contracts
- Intent bus remains the primary collaboration mechanism for loosely-coupled work
- AgentTool is for tightly-coupled cases where one agent always needs another's output (e.g., Diagnostician consumes Vitals Monitor metrics)
- Trust and consensus still apply — wrapping doesn't bypass governance
- Natural fit for Phase 26 Inter-Agent Deliberation

---

### Self-Improvement Pipeline (Phase 30)

*The mechanism that allows the ship to upgrade itself — with the Captain's approval.*

The infrastructure for a closed-loop improvement cycle: discover capabilities, evaluate fit, propose changes, validate results, and learn from outcomes.

**Stage Contracts (Typed Agent Handoffs)**

- Formal I/O specifications for inter-agent task handoffs
- Each contract declares: input artifacts, output artifacts, definition of done, error codes, max retries
- Enables reliable multi-step workflows where agents hand off work to each other with clear expectations

**Capability Proposal Format**

- Typed schema for "here's what was found, why it matters, and how it fits"
- Fields: source (repo/paper/API), relevance score, architectural fit assessment, integration effort estimate, dependency analysis, license compatibility
- Proposals flow through a review queue with approve/reject/modify actions

**Human Approval Gate**

- Stage-gate mechanism that pauses automated pipelines for Captain review
- Approval queue surfaced via HXI, shell, or API
- Supports approve, reject, or modify-and-resubmit workflows
- Audit trail of all decisions for traceability

**QA Agent Pool**

- Automated validation agents that go beyond pytest
- Behavioral testing: does the new capability actually improve the metric it claimed to?
- Regression detection: did anything break?
- Performance benchmarking: latency, memory, throughput before and after
- Shapley scoring to measure marginal contribution of new capabilities

**Evolution Store**

- Append-only store of lessons learned from capability integrations (successes, failures, and why)
- Time-decayed retrieval: recent lessons weighted higher, stale lessons fade
- Fed into episodic memory and dream consolidation for cross-session learning
- Future Science team agents query this store to avoid repeating past mistakes

**PIVOT/REFINE Decision Loops**

- Autonomous decision points in multi-step workflows: proceed, refine (tweak and retry), or pivot (abandon and try a different approach)
- Artifact versioning on rollback: previous work is preserved, not overwritten
- Hard iteration caps to prevent infinite loops

**Capability Injection (Adapter Bundle)**

- Agents declare needed capabilities (search, store, fetch, notify) via typed Protocol interfaces
- Runtime injects concrete implementations at startup
- Swappable providers without changing agent code (e.g., swap OpenAlex for Semantic Scholar)
- Recording stubs for testing: log calls without side effects, verify agent behavior in isolation

**Multi-Layer Verification (Anti-Hallucination)**

- Graduated verification of agent-produced claims against external sources
- Multiple verification layers, each catching what the previous missed (e.g., direct ID lookup -> API search -> fuzzy title match -> LLM relevance scoring)
- Classifications: VERIFIED (high confidence), SUSPICIOUS (needs review), HALLUCINATED (fabricated), SKIPPED (unverifiable)
- Extends the trust network from binary success/fail to graduated confidence scoring
- Applied to research findings, generated references, claimed capabilities, and factual assertions
